            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex
                institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens
                outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
                experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus
                on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can
                also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.
                Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.[16]While a consensus over what is the most
                significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have attributed
                this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a dissatisfaction with the quality of public
                schools,greater affordability of private schools,[16] and non-availability of preferred field
                of study in government schools

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve.Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.[16]While a consensus over what is
                the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have
                attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a dissatisfaction with the quality
                of public schools,greater affordability of private schools, and non-availability of
                preferred field of study in government schools A further issue is whether part of the meaning of
                education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Demand for private schools has been growing over the years.[While a
                consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet

                schools, and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schoolsThe main field
                investigating education is called education studies. It
                examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has,
                and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education,
                sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history
                of education. In pre-history, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation.
                With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented and the amount of knowledge grew. This
                caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to
                elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more
                widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public
                education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available
                to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.
